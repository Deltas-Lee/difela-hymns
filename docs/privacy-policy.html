  <p class="meta">App: Difela Tsa Sione — Hymns</p>

  <p>Last updated: <strong>14 September 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>This app provides an offline collection of hymns. It is designed to work without sending personal data to any server. This policy explains what (if any) data is processed and how.</p>

  <h2>Data we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No personal data collected:</strong> The app does not collect or transmit personally identifiable information (name, email, phone, etc.) to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Local device data:</strong> The app stores user preferences, bookmarks, and optional local exports on the user’s device. This data is stored only on the device unless you explicitly export or share it.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage & diagnostics:</strong> This release does not include analytics, crash reporting, or advertising SDKs. If such services are added later, this policy will be updated and the Play/App Store declarations will be updated accordingly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use data</h2>
  <p>Local preferences and bookmarks are used only to provide app functionality (restore last viewed hymn, favorites, settings). No user data is used for profiling or advertising.</p>

  <h2>Third‑party services</h2>
  <p>Currently no third‑party analytics, advertising, or backend services are integrated. If third‑party services are introduced, we will disclose them here (service name, purpose, and links to their privacy policies).</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app requests only the permissions required for its core features. This release does not request contact, location, camera, or microphone permissions. Any optional permission will be explained at point of use.</p>

  <h2>Data retention & exports</h2>
  <p>Local data remains on the device until the user deletes the app or removes data via the app. If an export feature exists, exported files are created and managed by the user.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We follow standard best practices for local data storage. Users are responsible for securing their device. The developer does not have remote access to on‑device data.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children; if discovered, it will be removed promptly.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>Material changes will be posted here with an updated date. You can always view the current policy at this URL.</p>
